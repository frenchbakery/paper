If user don't want or can't to use passkeys there are diffrent options how they could protect their sensitive information.
User can write their passwords with account info into a booklet. The passwords would be unique and strong. It's a really simple idea but also has a lot of drawbacks. 
For example:

User need to carry the booklet with them everywhere. If not they can't always access their accounts.
User can lose the booklet. If that happens they can't access any of their accounts anymore.
It's not a really clear way of organizing passwords. Once something is written down user can't change the position in the booklet. So users would have to search for each
passoword for indefinite time before they find it.

The other option is a password safe.
