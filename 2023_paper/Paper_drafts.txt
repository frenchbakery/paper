Future State of art:
In the future passwords will likely be replaced by passkeys because they are easier to use, securer, faster and work on almost every device a user could have.


What is a passkey (Connection with 2factorA.)\\
A passkey is similar to the 2-factor-authentication without the first factor. The second and only factor is the users device's security method such as a pin or a biometirc
sensor (fingerprint, face scan).

Function:
The passkey is hardware specific, which means user always need to carry their device (that the passkey is installed on) with them. If user want to use passkey on 
their laptop they need to verify themselves with their phone. This eliminates phishing, credential stuffing and other remote attacks. 

In conlusion when a user is asked to sign-in to an app or website, the user approves the sign-in with the same biometric or PIN that the user has to unlock the device 
(phone, computer or security key). The app or website can use this mechanism instead of the traditional (and insecure) username and password.
